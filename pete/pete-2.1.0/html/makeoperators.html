    <p>
      <b>MakeOperators</b> - make the operator functions for a given set of classes
      that return expression trees, so that PETE can be used with those classes.
      Also can construct global assignment operators and operator tag structs.

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      In order to use PETE with a given set of container classes,
      operators such as <TT>+, -, *, /</TT> etc. must be defined to return expression
      template parse trees when given those classes.
      Operators must be defined for combining the container classes,
      <TT>B + C</TT>, for combining the container classes with scalars,
      <TT>2 * C</TT>, and for combining parse trees with other objects,
      <TT>B + (C + D) + 2</TT>.
      To generate the <a href="builtin.html">PETE built-in operators</a>
      requires over 200 different templated operator functions to interface
      PETE with a single container class such as the STL vector.
     </p>

    <p>
      Command line options are:
     </p>

    <h3>--help<br>--pete-help</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Print a simple summary of the command options.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--classes classfile</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Input the class definitions from the file "classfile".
	Omitting this option causes no operator functions to be produced,
	which can be useful if you only want to produce operator tags.
      </p>
      <p>
	To understand the format of the input file, consider the STL vector.
	<b>MakeOperators</b> will output definitions for <TT>operator+()</TT>
	between vectors and vectors and between vectors and scalars:
      </p>
      <pre>
template&lt;class T1,class Allocator1,class T2,class Allocator2&gt;
(parse tree return type)
operator+(const vector&lt;T1,Allocator1&gt; &v1,const vector&lt;T2,Allocator2&gt; &v2)
{
  (construct parse tree)
}
template&lt;class T1,class T2,class Allocator2&gt;
(parse tree return type)
operator+(const T1 &v1,const vector&lt;T2,Allocator2&gt; &v2)
{
  (construct parse tree)
}
template&lt;class T1,class Allocator1,class T2&gt;
(parse tree return type)
operator+(const vector&lt;T1,Allocator1&gt;& v1,const T2 &v2)
{
  (construct parse tree)
}
      </pre>
      <p>
	In order to construct the operator, the tool needs to know the
	template arguments <TT>"class T,class Allocator"</TT> and the
	templated form of the class <TT>"vector&lt;T,Allocator&gt;"</TT>.
	For the STL vector example the class definitions file would contain
	the four lines:
      </p>
      <pre>
classes
-----
  ARG   = "class T[n],class Allocator[n]"
  CLASS = "vector&lt;T[n],Allocator[n]&gt;"
      </pre>
      <p>
	The string <TT>[n]</TT> needs to be attached to each template
	argument and represents a number that allows
	<b>MakeOperators</b> to uniquely
	identify each argument in binary and trinary operators.
	For classes with no template arguments, use <TT>ARG  = ""</TT>.
	In general, the class definition definition file can look like:
      </p>
      <pre>
classes
-----
  ARG   = (class 1 args)
  CLASS = (class 1 definition)
-----
  ARG   = (class 2 args)
  CLASS = (class 2 definition)
...

extraClasses
-----
  ARG   = (extra class 1 args)
  CLASS = (extra class 1 definition)
...
scalars
-----
  ARG   = (scalar 1 args)
  CLASS = (scalar 1 definition)
...
      </pre>
      <p>
	When multiple classes are listed, operators are produced for all
	combinations of those classes with each other, with scalars and
	with expression objects.
      </p>
      <p>
	The second optional list starting with
	the word <TT>extraClasses</TT> is used if you want to extend
	a previously created file.  For example, if you produced a file
	defining all the operators for <TT>vector&lt;T&gt;</TT> and
	wanted to extend your implementation to operations between
	vectors and <TT>list&lt;T&gt;</TT>, then you would list vector
	as a class and list under extraClasses and specify the option
	<TT>--extra-classes</TT>.  The resulting file would define
	operations between lists and lists, and between lists and
	vectors, but omit those between vectors and vectors, so that
	you could include both the new file and your previously
	generated file.
	Typically, it would be better to simply create a new file
	with all the operators, so extraClasses should rarely be
	used.
      </p>
      <p>
	The final part of this list that begins
	with the word <TT>scalars</TT> will only rarely need to be used.
	By the rules of partial specialization, if any class does not appear
	in the classes list, it will be treated as a scalar.  Suppose you
	were to define a tensor class <TT>Tensor&lt;T&gt;</TT>, then
	<TT>Tensor&lt;T&gt;() + vector&lt;Tensor&lt;T&gt &gt;()</TT> would
	invoke the right function: <TT>T1 + vector&lt;T2&gt;</TT> (which
	means treat the tensor on the left as a scalar and add it to each
	of the tensors in the vector of tensors).
	A problem arises if you also define scalar operations with tensors
	of the form <TT>Tensor&lt;T1&gt; + T2</TT> to represent adding a
	scalar to each of the tensor components.
	In this case
	<TT>Tensor&lt;T&gt;() + vector&lt;Tensor&lt;T&gt &gt;()</TT>
	is ambiguous as it matches the function for adding scalars to
	vectors and the function for addint tensors to scalars.
	To resolve this case, we must explicitly define
	<TT>Tensor&lt;T&gt; + vector&lt;Tensor&lt;T&gt &gt;</TT>,
	which will happen if we add <TT>Tensor&lt;T&gt;</TT> to the list
	of scalars.  (So the list of scalars only needs to contain classes
	that act like scalars but that also define operations between
	themselves and classes of arbitrary type.)

    <h3>--o outputfile</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Send MakeOperators output to outputfile; otherwise write to stdout.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--operators opfile</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Include the operator descriptions from the file "opfile".
	Typically this option should be omitted, in which case
	the set of 45 <a href="builtin.html">PETE built-in operators</a>
	are used.  See the file
	<a href="PeteOps.html"><TT>src/Tools/PeteOps.in</TT></a>
	in the PETE distribution to see operator descriptors for all the
	PETE built-in operators.
	The general format of an operator descriptor file is:
      </p>
      <pre>
type1
-----
  TAG      = "tag"
  FUNCTION = "function"
  EXPR     = "expression"
-----
  TAG      = "tag"
  FUNCTION = "function"
  EXPR     = "expression"
...

type2
-----
  TAG      = "tag"
  FUNCTION = "function"
  EXPR     = "expression"
...
      </pre>
      <p>
	The string <TT>"tag"</TT> is the name of a tag class that is used
	in expression template nodes to differentiate between the different
	operators.  For example, <TT>"OpAdd"</TT> is used for binary
	<TT>operator+()</TT>,  <TT>"OpSubtract"</TT> is used for binary
	<TT>operator-()</TT>, and so on.
	The string <TT>"function"</TT> is the name of the operator funtion,
	<TT>"operator+"</TT> for example.
	The string <TT>"expression"</TT> contains the body of a function that
	evaluates the operator on specific elements.  The string should
	use the names a, b, and c to represent the arguments to the function.
	For example the definition of binary <TT>operator+()</TT> sets
	<TT>EXPR  = "return (a + b);"</TT>.
      </p>
      <p>
	The headings <TT>type1</TT>, <TT>type2</TT>, etc. are operator types.
	Currently the following operator types are supported:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><b>unaryOps</b> - simple unary operators whose return
	  type is the same as their input type
	</li>
	<li><b>unaryBoolOps</b> - unary operators that return a bool</li>
	<li><b>unaryCastOps</b> - actually binary operators where the first
	  argument is used to set the return type (like peteCast).
	</li>
	<li><b>unarySpecialOp</b> - unary operators that use the type computation
	  system to compute their return type.
	  For example <TT>real(Complex&lt;T&gt;)</TT> returns <TT>T</TT>.
	</li>
	<li><b>binaryOps</b> - simple binary operators that compute their
	  return type by promotion.
	</li>
	<li><b>binaryBoolOps</b> - binary operators that return a bool
	  (like <TT>&lt;</TT>).
	</li>
	<li><b>binaryLeftOps</b> - binary operators that return the type of
	  the left argument.
	</li>
	<li><b>binarySpecialOps</b> - unary operators that use the type computation
	  system to compute their return type.
	</li>
	<li><b>binaryAssignOps</b> - assignment operators like <TT>+=</TT>.
	  If operator functions are produced for these operators then they call
	  <TT>evaluate()</TT> instead of returning an expression tree.
	</li>
	<li><b>binaryAssignBoolOps</b> - assignment operators that always return
	  a bool, like <TT>andAssign</TT> which emulates the mythical <TT>&&=</TT>.
	</li>
	<li><b>assignOp</b> - <TT>operator=()</TT>.
	</li>
	<li><b>trinaryOps</b> - trinary operators like <TT>where()</TT> which
	  emulates <TT>?:</TT>.
	</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>--pete-ops</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Using the <TT>--operators</TT> causes the tool to use operator
	descriptors from a file, but not to use any of the pre-defined
	PETE operators.
	If you wish produce operators for BOTH operators read from a
	file AND the pre-defined PETE operators, the use
	<TT>--pete-ops</TT> as well as the <TT>--operators</TT>
	option.
	For example, the first two commands in the POOMA example below
	could be simplified to produce one file:
      </p>
      <pre>
MakeOperators --classes PoomaClass.in \
              --operators PoomaOps.in --pete-ops \
              --guard POOMA_ARRAY_ARRAYOPERATORS_H \
              --no-expression --o ArrayOperators.h
      </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--guard INCLUDE_GUARD</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	The code output by <b>MakeOperators</b> includes ifdefs to guard against
	multiple inclusion of the form:
      </p>
      <pre>
#ifndef INCLUDE_GUARD
#define INCLUDE_GUARD
 (code goes here)
#endif // INCLUDE_GUARD
      </pre>
      <p>
	If this option is omitted then <TT>INCLUDE_GUARD</TT> will
	default to either <TT>GENERATED_OPERATORS_H</TT> if the
	<TT>--classes</TT> option is present, or
	<TT>OPERATOR_TAGS_H</TT> otherwise.
	If you wish to omit the include guards from the output file,
	then use the option <TT>--guard ""</TT>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--scalars</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	When this option is present, only operations between classes and
	scalars are produced.  This option is useful in the situation
	mentioned in the description of <TT>--classes</TT>, where operators
	must be defined between containers and user defined scalars in order
	to resolve ambiguities.  In the example of a user defined tensor class,
	the user would probably only define a small set of operations with general
	scalars, like +, -, *, and /.  To produce smaller operator files,
	you could produce all the operators without tensors and then produce the
	operators between containers and tensors just for the smaller set of
	operators.  See the example section for an example of this case.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--extra-classes</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	When this option is present, only operations involving extraClasses
	are produced.  This option is useful if you want to create an
	operator file that extends a previously created operator file.
	See the <TT>--classes</TT> option for a description of
	extraClasses.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--no-expression</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	<b>MakeOperators</b> needs to define operations between parse
	tree objects and containers and scalars.
	In the expression <TT>A + ( B + C )</TT>,
	the subexpression <TT>( B + C )</TT> returns a parse tree object which
	must then be combined with the container <TT>A</TT>.
	Some users of PETE, like POOMA, wrap the result of operators inside
	their own container class, so there is no need to define such operators.
	(The sum of two POOMA arrays is an array containing an expression.)
	This flag turns off generation of operations with parse tree objects.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--assign-ops</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Generate global assignment operators that call the function
	<TT>evaluate()</TT>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--op-tags</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	Produce definitions of the operator tag classes.  PETE already contains
	definitions of all the PETE built-in operators, so this flag only needs
	to be used for user defined operators.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>--no-shift-guard</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	It is typical to define the operator <TT>ostream &lt;&lt; container</TT>,
	which can get confused with the operator <TT>T &lt;&lt; container</TT>
	under some circumstances.
	To avoid this problem, PETE only defines the shift operators between
	scalars and containers if the macro PETE_ALLOW_SCALAR_SHIFT is defined.
	If <TT>--no-shift-guard</TT> is selected, then the ifdefs that implement
	this guard are eliminated and shift operators between scalars and
	containers are always defined.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      Here we build operators to use STL vectors with PETE.
      The flag <TT>--assign-ops</TT> is present because we
      cannot define the assignment member functions for STL vectors.
    </p>

    <pre>MakeOperators --classes vectorDefs.in --assign-ops > VectorOperators.h</pre>

    <p>
      For POOMA, we create the built-in PETE operators, some special POOMA operators
      like <TT>real()</TT>, and finally operators between POOMA arrays and the POOMA
      Vector and Tensor scalars to disambiguate them.
      The flag <TT>--no-expression</TT> is used because POOMA wraps expressions
      inside POOMA arrays.
      The flag <TT>--assign-ops</TT> not used because POOMA arrays define assignment
      member functions.
      In the second command, <TT>--op-tags</TT> is used because the POOMA operator
      tag classes need to be defined.
      In the third command, <TT>--scalars</TT> is used because the first command
      has already defined operations between POOMA arrays for the operators in
      <TT>PoomaVectorOps.in</TT> (which is a subset of the PETE operators).
      In the fourth command, <TT>--o VectorOperators.h</TT> sends output to that
      file rather than stdout.
