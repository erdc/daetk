<p>This document is an introduction to PETE, a library of C++ classes
and templates for high-performance numerical computation.  PETE, which
stands for "Portable Expression Template Engine", uses a technique
called <em>expression templates</em> to eliminate data copying and the
creation of temporary variables.  As a result, PETE-based programs can
be as efficient as their C or Fortran equivalents.

<p>PETE was designed and implemented by scientists working at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory's Advanced Computing Laboratory.  These
scientists have written and tuned large applications on almost every
kind of microprocessor built in the last two decades.  PETE therefore
encapsulates its authors' understanding of how to get good performance
out of modern pipelined architectures and their multi-level memory
hierarchies.

<p>PETE is free for non-commercial use (i.e. your tax dollars have
already paid for it).  You can read its source, extend it to handle
platforms or problem domains that the core distribution doesn't cater
for, or integrate it with other libraries and your current
application, at no cost.  For more information, please see the <a
href="legal.html">license</a> information included in the appendix.

<p>Of course, nothing is perfect.  As of October 1998, some C++
compilers still do not support the full ANSI/ISO C++ standard.  Please
see PETE's <a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/pete">support page</a> for
a list of those that do.

<p>A second compiler-related problem is that most compilers produce
very long, and very cryptic, error messages if they encounter an error
while expanding templated functions and classes, particularly if those
functions and classes are nested.  Since PETE uses templates
extensively, it is not uncommon for a single error to result in
several pages of complaints from a compiler.  Programs that use
templates extensively are also still sometimes slower to compile than
programs that do not, and the executables produced by some compilers
can be surprisingly large.

<p>The body of this tutorial starts with <a href="background.html">a
discussion</a> of the two key concepts behind PETE: C++ templates, and
parse trees.  The tutorials that follow show how to apply PETE to
user-defined classes, and to third-party classes such as those in the
C++ Standard Template Library (STL). You may also wish to look at the
<a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/pete">PETE</a> web site for updates,
bug fixes, and general discussion.
As well, an introductory article on PETE appeared in the October 1999
issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.
